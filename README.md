## **Tetris**
  * The goal of Tetris is simple; you bring down blocks from the top of the screen. You can move the blocks around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them. The blocks      fall at a certain rate, but you can make them fall faster if you’re sure of your positioning. Your objective is to get all the blocks to fill all the empty space in a line at    the bottom of the screen; whenever you do this, you’ll find that the row of blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.
  * Once 10 rows are cleared, the level will increase.
  * With each level increase, the speed at which the tetrominos drop is increased
  * Once the screen is filled and a block hits the top, it's game over!

                                                  
*Controls*
  1. RIGHT and LEFT ARROW KEYS move Tetrominos left and right

  3. DOWN ARROW KEY will drop the tetromino quicker
                 
## **Asteroids**
 * The goal is to shoot as many to get as many points as possible.
 * Be careful! If an asteroid hits you, it's game over!

## **Snake**
  * The goal of snake is simple; get your snake as long as possible by eating the square blocks and try not to run into yourself while eating! If you do, it's game over.

*Controls*
